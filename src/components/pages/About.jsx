            The WBC MuayThai was established in 2004 under the World Boxing Council (WBC) as a non-profit organization, with a mission to develop professional Muay Thai worldwide, as an affiliated division of the WBC, adhering to the rules set by the Board of Boxing Sport (Office of Professional Sports) of the Sports Authority of Thailand.
            <br/><br/>
            WBC MuayThai was created to facilitate and sanction professional Muay Thai competitions to develop and expand Muay Thai worldwide and to foster Muay Thai at all levels and weight divisions with international safety standards for the development of Muay Thai as a world premier fighting art.
            <br/>            
            On November 26th, 2001, His Majesty, the King of Thailand, held a historic audience in Hua Hin, Thailand, with World Boxing Council President Dr. Jose Sulaiman and Pol. General Kovid Bhakdibhumi, WBC Vice–President and WBC Asian Boxing Council President.
            <br/><br/>
            Moreover, a short time later, the World Boxing Council established the WBC Muay Thai to rate fighters worldwide and sanction WBC MuayThai Title events. Pol. Gen. Kovid Bhakdibhumi was appointed the WBC MUAYTHAI Global Chairman.
            <br/><br/>
            Since its inception, the WBC MuayThai has promoted the sport of MuayThai worldwide. To this day, the WBC MuayThai is active in over ninety-five countries and territories, hosting professional, amateur and youth MuayThai championships across eighteen weight categories.
            <br/><br/>
            The World Boxing Council MuayThai’s core aim is to continue to showcase the culture and spirit of MuayThai, from Thailand to the world.
            <br/><br/>
            The WBC MuayThai adheres to the rules and regulations of the Sports Authority of Thailand and is actively involved in the WBC Clean Boxing Program to maintain fairness and an even playing field for all athletes.
